# Project Webbutveckling III

The final project of the course Webbutveckling III meant developing a website for Stäksundets samfällighet.

The project is developed by Fanny Ståhl.

## Development

This project has been developed in Visual Studio Code. 

## Installation and requirements

To use this project optimally you will need Git, Node, NPM and Gulp installed globally on your machine. Since the project's completion, Gulp has updated. This means that gulp 4 functionality is not supported in this project, as it uses gulp 3 syntax. Install gulp 3 locally in the project for it to work. 

The files provided include the source code for the project, but to run, the files need to be converted to the pub directory through automation with Gulp.
