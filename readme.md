# Project Webbutveckling III

The final project of the course Webbutveckling III meant developing a website for Stäksundets samfällighet.

The project is developed by Fanny Ståhl.

## Development

This project has been developed in Visual Studio Code. 

## Installation and requirements

To use this project optimally you will need Git, Node, NPM and Gulp installed globally on your machine. The database needs to be set up locally with MySQL. Use the .sql-file to create the table in your database.

The files provided include the source code for the project, but to run, the files need to be converted to the pub directory through automation with Gulp.
